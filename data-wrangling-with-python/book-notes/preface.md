# Preface #

After finishing this book, Wes McKinney’s Python for Data Analysis is recommended.

Using a project-based approach, each chapter will grow in complexity. 
We encourage you to follow along and apply the methods using your own datasets. 
If you don’t have a particular project or investigation in mind, sample datasets will be available online for your use.

## How This Book Is Organized? ##
The structure of the book follows *the life span of an average data analysis project or story*:
+ Formulating a question.
+ Acquire the data
+ Clean the data
+ Explore the data
+ Communicate the data findings
+ Scale with larger datasets
+ Automate the process.
So more time can be spent focused on the content and analysis.

## What Is Data Wrangling? ##
Data wrangling is about taking a messy or unrefined source of data and turning it into something useful.
This allows you to take data no one would bother looking at and make it both clear and actionable.

## What to Do If You Get Stuck ##
When you are stuck and you work through the problem, 
you gain knowledge that allows you to grow and learn as a developer and data analyst. 
**Most people do not master programming; instead, they master the process of getting unstuck.**

A good idea is to be involved with local Python group using [meetup](http://www.meetup.com).
